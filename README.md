# Visualizing Community Vulnerability in Liberia's Border Regions
This repo is a result of data analysis completed as part of the 2016 Summer of Maps Program. This work was completed in support of a pro bono project with the American Red Cross. 

Summer of Maps is a fellowship program organized and facilitated by Azavea. Azavea is a B Corporation that specializes in civic-minded GIS software development and spatial analysis.

Summer of Maps offers stipends to student spatial analysts to perform data analysis and visualization for non-profit organizations. Every year we match up non-profit organizations that have spatial analysis needs with talented students to implement projects over a three-month period during the summer.

The purpose of this work is to spatially visualize and statistically analyze community vulnerability in Liberia's border regions.
The intended use of this work is to inform the Red Cross's programming in Liberia's border regions.
This work includes contributions from Annaka Scheeres, who was the lead developer and designer for this project, Esther Needham, who was the Summer of Maps mentor, and various employees at the Red Cross who conducted the community surveys in Liberia and created vulnerability indices.
